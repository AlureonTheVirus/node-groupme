Inspired by [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js), `node-groupme` aims to replace the obsolete [groupme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/groupme) package with a modern, object-oriented, intuitive approach to interacting with the GroupMe API.

This community-led effort is made possible by the [unofficial GroupMe API Community Docs](https://github.com/2CATteam/GroupMeCommunityDocs). Please contribute to the development of open-source applications by contributing to the community docs.

Join the [official GroupMe API development chat](https://groupme.com/join_group/27317261/ibNNhx) to discuss the API or ask any questions.
